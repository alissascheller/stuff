I think it's great when people have a passion for wanting and having children especially if the couple or person is capable of giving that child a good upbringing to where they will grow up to be a good person and a productive adult. At the same time, I see too many people who are not adequate as parents just raising another child who is going to turn into an irresponsible adult who doesn't know how to function in society. If people really want to make a difference why don't they adopt and help give a child in need a good life if possible. I would even go so far as to say that having children in this day and age is selfish when there are so many children who are without parents waiting on someone to come and love them.  Seeing that I am 27, my feelings on the matter could always change and I may decide that I want children.

However, it was more loving myself enough to know the difference;  Trusting myself to know what I deserved and what a child would deserve and need. Understanding the unconditional love that was necessary for a child to thrive and become a beautiful member of the universe.  

There is a part of me that has always wanted to have children.  However, there is a greater part of me that understood the sacrifice it would take to have children.  While I completely trust and believe a woman, or man for that matter, is capable of raising a child independently, it was not something I saw myself doing... raising a child alone.   

In order for me to be in a place where I felt secure to raise a child, I felt I would need to be in a relationship with a partner. In order for me to be in a relationship with a partner, I needed to love and understand myself.   And since it took me until my 40's to find a life partner that would compliment who I am, I was not ready and able to have children and provide the children with the absolute love I felt in my heart they deserved.  

So, I do not have any biological children of my own and that is okay.  I am blessed with, at this time, 10 beautiful nieces and nephews and friend's children that I consider nieces and nephews.  I have a partner whose son loves me in a way that I am grateful.  I work in the school system with children I care for every single day.

Realistically, there are countless social, political and economic issues that prevent me from desiring to have kids and bring them into a world that seems to be spiriling out of control. The decline of the education system for the rise of standardized testing, the imminent threat of climate change, over a decade in war and occupation abroad are just a few real-life issues that I would not want to bring a child into. I also don't thing it is selfish of a women to want to prioritize their life to ensure the effort and realization of personal fulfillment. What others may misconstrue a selfish act of refusing to have children can actually be considered a self-less act instead - one where a woman wants to realize her potential by focusing on her life before bearing children out of the societal or familial pressure to do so when they are not fully ready to.

Doing something just because it's the norm or because it's what society expects has never been my way (but my lack of respect for authority is for another day).
Now happily married for two years, my husband and I are both self-employed, we foster rescue dogs (and have adopted two seniors), and our new in-ground pool for our backyard oasis was delivered today. We live a life that we very much enjoy, but that will never include children.

It's nearly out-of-body, the intensity to have the typical family. They've mothered baby dolls, melted over babies on the street and dream of having their own to push around in the stroller for others to awe at. 
I've never had this. Baby dolls scared me, I didn't even like other kids while being a kid. I've never had that longing to be a mother. It's never hit me and it never will. 
It's not just the incredible financial responsibilities or the fact I wouldn't ever be able to sleep again, it's the fact I don't WANT to give up my money or sleep. I don't want to sacrifice everything in my life, all I want to do and become in order to be a mother. Sure, you can be incredibly successful while having children but it's never the same way. Your freedom is very limited, there is a ceiling, even if it's a very high one. 
And quite frankly, I don't care what anyone thinks. I've been called selfish and told endlessly how I'll ""change my mind."" As if not going with what society typically deems acceptable is somehow a temporary lapse in judgement. 
I've worked with children, all types, for over a decade. Throughout all of that time, never once did I fantasize about having any of my own. The thought of even considering it never once came up.

I  have no regrets whatsoever. As I was child free I able to be very present for the homeless teenage mothers in the shelter where I was working. I am very connected to animals and have many young people in my life who I am aunty  / grandmother  / mentor to.

For young women who have bought into the feminist lie that ""you can have it all"" I would say follow your heart not the external pressures placed on you and if you are not able to resolve the ""yes"" or ""no"" question-  go on a vision quest with respected older women and see what comes forth for you.

It is often difficult to connect with the inner wise Goddess in a world of male Gods, patriarchy and systems that are designed around concrete, recycled air in sealed buildings where women are often having to act and think and dress  like men in order to succeed.

PS  None of the 5 choice questions really apply to my situation so I clicked at random and  would like to suggest you include ""other"" rather than restrict women to 5 choices that may or may not be relevant.

5/5/2015 22:12:14,I like my life as it is.,"With being the only one of my graduating class that isn't married and/or has kids, I've taken this time to think on my decisions (no relationship or kids) and I've realized that it's the best choice for me right now. Why?

I turn twenty-five on Thursday. I've learned a lot of things since I turned seventeen and the most important thing is that you have to put yourself first. You have to give yourself time to find yourself and who you are, as stereotypical as it sounds. You don't have to be afraid to say no or to take care of yourself - it's not selfish. Because if you don't do this? You'll be plagued with what ifs and those what ifs can turn septic.

I've lived all over the United States since I was seventeen. California, Kansas, Minnesota, Georgia, South Carolina, and Pennsylvania. I'm looking at jobs in New York City and Seattle currently - and even in London and possibly even Moscow. If I had kids? My prospects of jobs would be limited and I more than likely couldn't take any of these opportunities. Why? Because they come first. 

By no means am I saying having kids is a life or fun ender,  but when you have children - they become your priority. There's no more random roadtrips with friends or cross country flights to go see friends. There's no more staying out late drinking and singing karaoke. When you have kids, they become your first priority. Their safety, their wellbeing, their happiness. There is no more you. There is just your child.

I say this as the eldest child of four who's helped raised a brother with Aspergers' and as a Nanny for multiple families. I've been there for the first steps, the first words, the first teeth lost, and any other developmental stage a child hits. I, myself, was raised by a single mother who had me at twenty-two and despite her telling me that she regrets none of it - I can see that she's plagued by the what-ifs.

I've always taken care of children - I love kids - and while I'm not completely against having children, I'm not going to do it until I feel it's stable to do so. With how the state of our country is - with the rampant racism, sexism, and homophobia amongst other things - I'd rather concentrate on making the world a better place (as naive as it sounds) before I bring in another human life to this world.

And at the rate the world's going?

I won't be.

Having a child would not only limit my work duties, it would limit the amount of travelling I would be able to do.

Kids are also incredibly expensive. I have five nephews and a niece that range in age from 24 years old to  six months and I've listened to my sisters and brother in laws complain about how much they've had to spend on everything from diapers and formula to college tuition. It never ends.

Right now I can decide to do anything with little to no planning. I live in New York City and I have the amazing opportunity to jump on the subway and see a Broadway play the moment I think of it. I also woke up and decided that I wanted to go to Hawaii so I booked a flight and left the same day. You can't make any moves like that with children. I'm planning a group trip for my 30th birthday next July and when I've talked to my friends with children it has been a very familiar response; I need to find a sitter.

The task of socializing a child now is exponentially more difficult than when I was growing up. The ease with which my child's mistakes can be documented and distributed is staggering and can create so many problems in growing up well-adjusted. We've seen the story many times over in the media: it's no longer a world of picking on the 'loser' (or the chubby kid, or the slut, or whatever other labels have been placed on an individual). It's a world where children can mock that person online, create memes about them, make lists about them (and others) and distribute them, take video and post it for laughs. The reality of children being cruel is not new. But the reality of the reach of their cruel behavior is relatively new and not something I would subject my child to. 

I think there are also elements of not wanting to bring my child into a world that is so much like the 60s in terms of social mobility for people of color. We are fed the idea that change has arrived, that we are living in a post-racial world but I don't really think it's true. Staying middle class for people of color is a harder task now than it was when I was growing up and I feel that that isn't really something that is widely talked about. ",

I didn't even understand kids when I was a kid and I think that my dislike of children is exactly that. I have no idea how to interact with them and it's always an awkward mess. I do love my nieces and nephews though and I don't hate children at all but I have a max amount of time I can spend with kids and then I meet my threshold and can't deal anymore. Kids are 24/7 - 7 days a week. You don't get a break. When you have kids you can't give them back and say ""oops I made a mistake I wanted to try this and it's not for me."" It's a commitment you cannot fail at without dire consequences to everyone involved. So when people say, ""well you'll never understand until you have kids."" What they are saying is that I need to try parenthood and childrearing before I can fully comprehend how amazing it is. When I can do that just fine without having to actually participate, and the reason I don't want to participate is because I understand. I make decisions all the time without having to participate in them and fully understand and am able to make a decision based on my comprehensive knowledge of that subject. And the caveat again is that I cannot participate in childrearing and then say ""nope, not for me"" and then change my mind and give the child away like I would spit out food I've tried and don't like. I don't want to bring a child into this world that feels like a burden or a mistake as I did when I was a child because of this notion, when I'm fully capable as a person to understand the amount of work, dedication, and sacrifice it takes to be a parent and to raise a child and to know that not all persons should have children and not all persons make good parents. And we could do with a little more forethought put into the decision that is made to have children and because of this change the expectation that all people should have children. 

Also, there is a whole lot of mess around the assistance provided to women in the USA when it comes to having a family and the sexist expectations from work and society in regards to being a woman having children. And I'm not cool with those, they aren't helpful in persuading me to have children either, but I think it would benefit a lot of women if these types of arrangements were prioritized such as family leave and paid sick leave and free childcare through work and after school programs, and reassurance that you won't lose your job or be hired because of being pregnant or the possibility that you may have or start a family. This would improve the argument that you cannot have a career and being a good parent, if women want both they should be able to have both just like men with families and thus, why I have decided also not to have children because it is not conducive at this time to also having a career and focusing on that path of where I want to be in my career. Unfortunately for women, it's still a choice of prioritizing one over the other, even if you have a career one of them always has to come first and that's unfortunate when they should have a semblance of work/life balance and for the majority of women with families or in their decision to opt out this comes into play and that work/life balance does not exist.

I've always known since I was very young that I've never wanted kids, and now that I'm almost 27 that feeling has not changed and won't ever change. I know it won't change.

I have the most amazing boyfriend ever and he also doesn't want kids of his own. We have talked extensively about this and other things, and neither could we afford to properly take care of one anyways, though that has never been the ultimate deciding factor in not wanting kids.

I love my life as it is and have many plans for my future, kids just are not a part of that plan, and I'm not insecure like all these other people who have kids ""just so someone will take care of them when they are older"". You cannot guarantee that your kids will ever take care of you when you're old and grey; that's a stupidly selfish reason just to have kids. I don't fear death and solitude like everyone else does; having kids so they can be your saving grace in the future is pathetic and that shouldn't be the reason to have kids.

And if I honestly change my mind in 10 years, I'll most likely adopt a kid that needs a family and won't bother creating more mouths to feed on an already overburdened planet. But I doubt I'd change my mind about wanting kids. I know what I want and what I don't want.",

I'm not sure if this was purposeful, but pretty much all of the reasons listed above are not the reality of most people that are child free by choice, but fall into stereotypical views that others have about people that choose not to have children.

I have an amazing marriage to the same person for 18 years. Thankfully, we both agreed to be child free by choice. We like children the same way we like adults. Summer great, some aren't. We both used to babysit at various points when we were kids. I was a special ed teacher. We love our nieces nephews. In other words, we can't answer that we don't like children.

We both have a wonderful careers, but didn't choose to prioritize her career as a main reason for not having children. I had great parents so I can't use an excuse that my parents sucked. :-)

The bottom line to us is that parenting is a calling and we just weren't called to it. It's that simple. Not everyone is driven to do everything in life and this is something we were driven to do.

We feel that it's not selfish to be child free by choice, but instead it self-aware. We are knowledgeable in the fact that we don't want to be parents and we don't do it just because of peer pressure.

That helps give you a great perspective that's a lot more complex, dynamic, truthful, and a stereo typical and the multiple-choice answers you listed above.",

The questions  the society asks about reasons for not having children, the questions themselves imply that ""normal people"" want to have children like a biological impetus towards eating food and drinking water. 

It's like this:

I can wear a dress and some expect that women should, but I don't feel the desire for a dress. I'm a woman and feel no need to prove my femininity by wearing makeup or dress or by breeding. 

I figured I should have children if I really really really want them because they deserve full commitment. But I never did. I'm in my 40's and totally happy not having children. People could call me selfish but I don't care. It's not their life or body. Is it not selfish for women to have children not because they want children but because they want to fit in with the social and cultural expectations? Women often seem to have children with ulterior social and financial motives even to this day. They have children expecting that the offspring will take care of them in their old age. Is that not selfish? Having children as a self-validation so they can tell the world about their saintly sacrifices? (You can tell my family relationships were rough, right?)

So I'm happily childless, and anyone has a problem with it, it's their personal problem.",

For starters, pregnancy. Who hasn't known a pregnant woman who is in agony from something or another? Why would I want to go through pregnancy? After you most likely push this baby out of your body and experience the most excruciating pain known to woman, you no longer get any sleep, you devote every waking moment to this child. Not only do you have to nurture the child, you have to teach it and raise it to what you hope to be a decent human being. And then you send it off into this horrible world that does not need any more humans. Not to mention the insane amount of money it costs to bring a child into this world. You're in debt with hospital bills before the child is even born. And if your child is lucky enough to get into college, forget about any savings to might have had. I do not wish to be responsible for something other than myself. To have to constantly worry about their well being. To hope they're not horrible people.

I have no desire to be as swollen as a planet for nine months, to pick up after others for the rest of my life, or to be tied down by expenses that come with child-rearing. I have never felt any inclination towards the “joys” of motherhood either. The lifestyle is simply not appealing enough, and it has never been.

I was never one of those girls who dreamt of white wedding dresses, a happy marriage, a house full of children. I never listed down the names of future offspring, as so many of my peers are wont to do. I have never understood why women in particular like rubbing pregnant women’s bellies, or cooing at babies they see on the street. I can’t imagine myself waking up in the middle of the night to tend to children's screams, or dragging myself out of bed to drive them to lessons, or wondering where to get money for their tuition and unending requests for fast food, gadgets, and theme parks. These things have simply never made sense to me, and I feel that children are a hindrance to the life I want to have and the world I want to discover.

You may argue that there is a way to have it all: have children, a career, and travel the world. I agree, I’m sure that there is a way. I could also own an elephant, an English castle, and a wax museum of Star Wars characters. Yes I can, but I don’t want to. Parenthood is a choice, and everybody gets to decide. And in the end we all live with the path we took and make the most of it.

PS: Many people have already said that the reasons you listed above are limited. They are. Here are some other reasons I don't want to have children: (1) the toll pregnancy takes on a woman's body, (2) the depressing condition of the world around us, (3) the toll our population is taking on the environment, (4) the immense emotional, financial, and physical responsibility of raising children, (5) the stereotypes of women as simply child-bearers is something I wish to defy.

The world does not need more humans, the world is coping with all the strain... supply and demand... trash... carbon footprints... the list goes on and on. I do not need to have children just because I can have them. Planet earth could do with a people reduction, not a people influx. 

I have nothing against children and if I were to fall pregnant by some slim statistic of failed contraceptive methods, then I would embrace the baby and love it with all my heart.

My parents were wonderful, they had four kids and I saw what a blessing and a curse it was to be responsible for us all. Everyday was a struggle, our whole childhood we were broke.

I have nothing against children, I just think it's not the right time or place to be reproducing in this world. For me anyway... and my partner couldn't agree more. It's too expensive nowadays. We have our furry pet family to take care of and they come first!

It's nice that myself and my partner see eye to eye on that.

While other little ones played with played with dollies, pretending to be a mother I was more interested in re-enacting scenes from movies or pretending to be a Pokémon master. I never got why you would want to pretend to be a mom, like, where was the fun in that?

Once I was older, in around the fifth grade, I announced for the first time that I never wanted to have children. That if I ever did have a child I wanted to adopt it, and I was very specific about wanting to only adopt older children. My family and teachers assumed this was just a reaction to having a four-year-old little sister and a one-year-old little brother, but as young as ten I knew, really knew, that a biological child of my own was never something I wanted.

Now in my early twenties my family are beginning to actually listen to and take serious my desire to never have children. It's been interesting putting facts and figures behind the idea as I've grown as well. Now my mainly cited reason is genetics, as depression runs in my family so badly that it has destroyed members of my family. How could I pass that along knowing that this thing, everyone claims you love so wholly and immediately, could one day implode in their own despair? 

Next is the responsibility factor and it is a big one. I, like many many women, know plenty of people who married and had children right out of high school, and with every year I grow deeper into my twenties the amount of old classmates with children grows. Thankfully my core friend group is still child free, and there have been many a night wherein the absolute despair parents have to endure has been the topic of discussion. That may seem selfish, but I recognize my supposed selfishness, and add it to the artillery of reasons why parenthood is never going to be for me. 

Lastly, the cost. It costs thousands of dollars just to bring the damn thing into the world, and then you have to support it and keep it from dying for almost two decades. That is a hell of an investment, and for what kind of return? A sense of knowing a job well done? The satisfaction of molding a human to your liking? Fulfilling some kind of internalized need to fill society with more well adjusted people? It all seems like a big waste of all of the money from the best years of your life. Give me an expensive pillow top mattress, fancy cheeses, and all the traveling I can afford. All while I'm still young, and forever unattached. 

I look forward to being the aunt that can help pay for a really cool senior trip, and always gets you the best christmas presents (aside from Santa). An ear for my future nieces and nephews to go to when they aren't sure if their parents will understand. Yeah, give me the status of 'Cool Aunt' any day, sounds great.",

However, as a newly minted attorney, I realize how much time I need to put in at work for at least the next couple of years if I want to have as successful a career as I desire. I specifically chose a firm that has much more flexibility and better work/life balance than most, but even still, I feel as though I can't be constantly worrying about children throughout the day. I had originally planned on having a stay at home husband to take care of things while I focused on work, and my soon to be ex husband was quite enthusiastic about that plan many years ago when we started dating. However, as time has passed and I entered law school and then graduated from law school, he's grown more and more disinclined to fulfill that role. He was extremely unsupportive during law school, and I don't believe he will be any better if we have kids together. So, as of now, I will simply not be having children.",
5/6/2015 5:07:34,I like my life as it is.,"I am a 54 year old woman who decided several years ago that I would not have children. Throughout my 20's, I just didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, so I wasn't ready to make the decision to become a mother. To me, once a person decided to have children, you couldn't take that back. It would be your life. I never felt committed to it. 

So In my 30's, I had more clarity about what I wanted to do, which was to become a counselor. I still needed to go to college and graduate school. So again, it didn't feel right to have children. I went to college, then to graduate school, also working full time through the experience. I knew other people who had children who were in school and working, too. I just can't imagine what that would be like. My sister was also working and going to school full-time with 2 children at home. I believed at the time that her children were not getting the attention they needed because she was rarely home.

Now I am very independent and happy with my life. I am a counselor in my own private practice and a supervisor at a mental health agency. I love my life. I used to wonder if I would regret my choice, but I do not. 

I sometimes wonder why I chose to be without children since most people I know have families and children. My parents were very unhappy people when I was growing up. Neither one of my parents seemed happy nor did they seem happy to have a family. My mother used to say that she didn't ""know what I would do without you kids."" But I remember that I didn't believe her. I didn't understand why she would say that because I didn't believe she really felt that way. She seemed so unhappy with her life. I was also the oldest, so a lot of responsibility fell on me to take care of my brother and sister. My father was and is and alcoholic and was never home. My parents divorced when I was 10 and my father disappeared from my life. 

Parenthood did not look attractive to me when I was a kid. Then I started seeing young people in their late teens and early 20's having kids. I remember thinking how much responsibility it would be to have children. Those people did not seem prepared to me and some of them weren't. 

I am glad I didn't have kids in my 20's because I was not ready to be a parent. I think now I would be a great parent, but I am 54 and don't want that responsibility. 

I don't spend a lot of time with kids now, either. I like kids. But like quiet time. Reflective time. I have a busy life and like to relax when I am not working.

There are a lot of layers to my decision not to have children and these are just some of my thoughts. Overall, I am very happy with my choice. ",

5/6/2015 5:33:40,I like my life as it is.,"First: My doctors have repeatedly advised against me having children due to my medical condition, Multiple Sclerosis.  

Second: Just because you can, does not equal you should.  We have a cultural idealism,that has been pounded into our sub-con; that you can only be happy if you have found your soulmate/true love.  I think so many young people are desperate to force this false expectation that they never truly think their decisions out long term. 
    In our current society the expenses of everyday life, far exceed that of 'minimum wage', combine the stresses of financial stability and the responsibility of raising an unplanned child... is it any wonder our divorce rate/single mother stats are as high as they are.  
    Counterpoint: There are a rising number of career/life plan directed women out there also, who have concentrated on their passion, that never allotted them time for relationships, but the underlining urge/need/want for that fulfillment of a child drove them to have their offspring at the age that was w/i their specific timeline.  
   I am only pointing out two of possibly hundreds of reasons why people choose to breed.  What is dumbfounding to me is I cannot go more that an hour of watching TV w/o seeing an ad for adopting a stray/abused/helpless dog or cat, I can not recall EVER seeing an ad or campaign encouraging adoption of our own species. (Donating money yes, but adoption no) There are almost 400,000 children in the United States needing a home.   Worldwide an estimated 153 million!  Let's put that into perspective the population of the United States was 318.9 million in 2014.  That is right almost nearly half of our population equals how many children need a home around the globe.  
    Is there anyone out there that can hear ""foster care"" or ""orphanage"" and only have happy thoughts?  Doubtful.

Thirdly: Enviromental Impact. If you are reading my words then you are able/have access to read the uncontradicted facts from the global scientific community the negative/devastating/detrimental effects humans are having on this planet.  We are all living/seeing the effects already.  The weather extremes, that were predicted to occur if we did not change our ways.... What is terrifing is that it is starting thirty years sooner than originally thought.  So it isn't 'our grandchildrens' (these mythical, non-existent beings) problem & responcibility to deal with.  We now, all of us are going to start to live through it, and those of you with children what pain will you feel seeing them suffer, knowing you were told this would happen, that we had to change our ways...l know you wanted to (deep down) but what an inconvenience it was...who had time for that???  It's almost as big of a pain as voting.  

Lastly:  Where is the sixth option?   Where is the option that's says: ""I do not want to have children because it is selfish""?  I try in every choice I make how will this effect everyone, not just me.  Having offspring is an expected outcome of unions with our life partners. Teaching our life lessons and experiences go hand and hand in rearing a child.  Unfortunately all I see on the news is how teachers aren't doing their part (parents are never to blame) to make sure they pass some corporations standards of education and that mythical beliefs are taught to challenge scientific facts.

5/6/2015 6:11:02,"I have a bad relationship with my parents., I don’t want the financial responsibility.","Bad relationship

As a child growing up in a single parent home with an older sibling, I often found myself without support. We didn't have a lot of money which maybe why I wasn't supported, however there seem to be money available when my sibling needed some. It wasn't just the financial aspect, there were moments when people would use me to experiment with, I felt I couldn't go to my parent, I felt she would blame those incidents on me. Not having support caused me to resent my parent and with that I'm terrified I'd end up treating my child they way I was treated. 

Financially

A recent study stated it would cost $245K to raise a child if the child were born in 2014, that's a lot of money especially for a single parent. I am lower middle class, I don't see how I would be able to afford children. Or even if I only wanted one child that is a lot of money. 

Not checked options

I wanted to be bring up three other reasons why I'm refraining from children. One reason is we as a society don't allow parents to parent. Parents are going to jail or being media shamed because they allow their children to do things they were allowed to do as children such as walk to school alone or with other kids, play in parks alone,  and stay at home alone. Even if a child is spanked if society says that shouldn't be done at that point in time, the parent gets attacked. If I'm just going to be jailed as my child changes and my journey as a parent continues, I can't justify the risk.
Another reason is because I'm an African American woman. Which means my children will be defined as African American. Being an African American child was not easy for me and it will not be easy for my children in this day. No matter the progress in race relations, I feel the stigma of being African Americans will never go away. Though my children may be good kids, in the eyes of some they'll just be 'thugs' as apparently it doesn't matter who you are it only matters the color of your skin. An example of this is President Obama. Mr. Obama is an attorney, former Senator, father, husband, and POTUS but yet the only thing people can point out is his skin color.
Lastly, the American career/work system does not cater to families like it does in other countries. In the United States women are guaranteed 3 months of unpaid leave after the child is born and men don't even get leave rather it be paid out unpaid. This type of disregard for the family unit by the American workforce confirms that that village we're always told that it takes to raise a child is more concerned with money than the overall health of the child.",

5/6/2015 7:04:42,I like my life as it is.,"Choosing not to have children at first was not a personal decision. At five years of age of told my mother that I wanted to be a foster parent. We attributed my need to save other children from my obsession with The Little Orphan Annie. My mother suffered from mental health illness. Our household wasn't the most pleasant. She would wake up early in the morning probably moreso from insomnia-but that meant rage. She would slam the cupboards and scream at the top of her lungs ""you stupid fucking whores! You stupid fucking bitches!"" This would trigger deep emotional stress for a child too young to carry. I didn't have anyone to talk to and I didn't have a way to express my emotions. I began self harming myself as a way of finding comfort and release. I would dig into my arms or literally bash my head against the wall. I wanted to die. My earliest memories of trying to commit suicide was at the age of 6. I would roll up a white windbreaker (this IS the 80's) with hot pink and bold purple trim from arm to arm like a long rope and I would tie it around my neck and make knots out what was suppose to be the arms. I had no concept of death or what that even meant. All I knew is that I wanted to die. Around the age of 8 I was sexually abused by my stepfather. In 5th grade I was sleeping over my friends house. She was a beautiful Korean-American heritage. I didn't really have friends growing up because of trust issues, but somehow we just clicked. In the middle of the night I sensed that something was wrong and I opened my eyes. I could only attribute my sexual abuse for kicking in my survival mechanism. There her father stood in the doorway, in his underwear. I thought to myself oh no not again. I swear I could hear my hear stop. I closed my eyes and when I opened them again he was gone. Just as I went to exhale, I saw his hands reaching up from the side of the bed and moving towards me to pull the covers off. I began coughing purposely. Needless to say Post traumatic Stress Disorder saved me from being abused that night. I was raped at 14 by another man. My biological fathers best friend tried approaching me once. I ended up in an abusive relationship. He raped me too. Around that time I was addicted, wreckless, and an alcoholic. Textbook classic case of what trauma can do to a person. The parents of my boyfriend at the time sat me down and said that they thought that I needed help. I was so offended, because their son was abusing me. To me it was like a slap in the face. I remained in denial for another two years about the fact that I too, like my mother suffered from mental health illness. At that time I did not have health insurance and I just wanted 'to get better'. My sister had a friend named Erica who had left self-help books at her home to encourage her to be ""free"" from emotional pain and trauma. I read both of those books and they changed my life forever. I would go to the library to read about mental health illness and better ways to cope. Throughout this time I had always had irregular, painful periods. I believe i experienced a miscarriage at the age of 16. I was having unprotected sex with my abusive ""fiancé"" for seven years and did not get pregnant. When I think back that in itself was a blessing. I finally came to the terms that I no longer needed to self-Medicate to cope with everyday life. I finally had learned to face my fears. I had the time to invest in me, sober, nurture myself, love myself, forgive, let go, and be free. Life began for me at the ripe ol' age of 21 and still had mental health illnesses and PTSD. Life hasn't been easy, but I have been working very hard on myself. In 2008 I ended up on disability after 3 years of homelessness, joblessness, and sickness. That is what years of trauma does-it catches up to you. It felt like the lowest moment of my life. Soon after I was able to have healthcare I began seeing doctors regularly. Around that time I started having heart troubles. In 2013 I was informally diagnosed by a gynecologist that I had ""findings of someone with PCOS"". PCOS is poly-cystic ovarian syndrome. Surely PCOS did not help my mental health. Throughout my life I longed to be a parent. I wanted to have a baby. I wanted to experience the joy and love of carrying a child and giving birth. Quite frankly I believe it was my biological clock, but my body didn't. I had to begin the process of acceptance. I'm 34 now and people say ""oh you are still young"" and ""there is still that .001% chance"". It irritates me to the core. I came to terms with just taking care of me. As you can see, it is a full time job. For me, it is the only form of 'suicide' that is socially acceptable-not having children to carry on our family's long lineage of mental health illness. It stops with me. I don't think there is a greater gift that I could give a child honestly. I will gladly be an auntie, I will love, protect, and care for children-just not the way a female is perceived by society to do or be. I am no longer on disability. I am now a community organizer for tenants rights in my hometown. An aspiration to improve housing and accountability for city officials and landlords to do their job that I had when I was in high school. My love and need to help and nurture people is through my work. My community. My home. I am happy with my life today, and take great pride of all of my experiences in life that have helped shape me to who I am today. No I'm not selfish for choosing not to have children. I don't want people to pity me. I'm not sorry for my life experiences. They were blessings in disguise. How many people can say they are loving life and have their dream job? Not many. Although I battle mental health illness every single day of my life I have self worth, self love, and have defied the odds. Choosing. Not to have children whether biological or through adoption is my right to choose. I not one to take kindly the stigma and stereotypes that society places on me. 34, childless, and not in a relationship? ""What is wrong with you?"" society says. Sometimes I think I'm the only one in my right mind. So-choosing to be childless was not the initial decision, but it grew to be the final decision when my life plan was already laid out for me. It was how I chose to come to terms with it that was key. ",

You could say we are both selfish in a way, we both enjoy our holidays and our stress free life and not having the responsibility of a child, in fact, our dog koby is the longest responsibility we have to this day! 
Despite all of this,  we do sometimes talk about children, and although we have never wanted to have any, we do agree that if we were in a better financial situation, we wouldn´t think about it.  The financial obligation is what sets us back the most. We would want to provide our child with our own home,  a good education and a bright future, but unfortunately,  in the current economy, it´s just too much of a gamble we can´t afford... ",

Soon it becomes that nothing in life could possibly matter more or merit more of your attention than your child's sticky hands. I've seen amazing, intelligent, interesting people unable to any longer form an opinion on important things, because they're only half present in their own bodies anymore. I like being a fully functional human being with choices and agency, and not enslaved to the small people terrorizing my home night and day. I like to sleep in. I like to cook what I want. I like to watch DVR'd episodes of Game of Thrones in the living room whenever I please. My husband and I like to make love on the couch. We like to frequent restaurants that serve alcohol and don't feature a scary clown or a kids menu. I like traveling where, when and how I want. To sum up, I like my freedom.

I don't really understand how people's main goal in life is to reproduce and how they can build their life around someone who doesn't exist yet. I will never understand how my ex seemed to love and care about the needs and wants of our potential child over mine and how it made me ""selfish"" that I didn't. I felt like he was only with me for my body but in this case, for what it had the potential to do. 
I love my career and my field and love that it is so demanding and time consuming. I am obsessed with work. I love traveling and doing what I want when I want without having to think twice or about someone else. I love sports cars that I would only sell for another (faster) sports car. I LOVE free time and sleep and become a zombie without it. I love my independence and never having to rely on others which is impossible with a child. I am very happy with my body and how it looks and feels and although I think post baby bodies are beautiful, I do not want one.  My relationship with my parents isn't horrible but it's not great and my mom would be very possessive and constantly tell me what to do.  
Probably the biggest reason for not having children is because after I gave up all of the above, no matter how hard I tried to hide it I would resent my children and be miserable with my life. They would feel unwanted, unloved and like a burden and I would NEVER want that for anyone. So I will leave kid having to the people who are good at it and remain child-free. 😎✌🏼",

In the words of Albert Bartlett ""Can you think of any problem in any area of human endeavor on any scale, from microscopic to global, whose long-term solution is in any demonstrable way aided, assisted or advanced by further increases in population, locally, nationally or globally?""

There are simply too many humans. We are sending other species extinct at 1000-10,000 times the speed at which the would go extinct naturally. We are causing the 6th great extinction. The planet does not belong to humans alone, we are but one species out of millions. Yet we refuse to share its resources. Every new human, no matter how environmentally conscious, requires housing, water, food (land for agriculture), fuel/energy 
etc.

I spend my time advocating for other species. I work 70 + hours a week in animal rescue and I spend my spare time doing population advocacy. Overpopulation is the elephant in the room, environmental charities won't talk about it, people think you're a eugenicist for daring to suggest people think before adding humans. This doesn't even take into account the fact that humans are in for a bumpy ride with runaway climate change around the corner. Who in their right mind wants to bring a child into a future that is so uncertain? 

There are so many children needing homes and i strongly support adoption for those wanting to raise a child. I was adopted and have a fantastic relationship with my adoptive parents and also with my birth mother.

I remember at the age of 10, watching them argue over money and staring at them (I can still remember what I was wearing as I poured my cereal in a bowl) and I thought, ""you're doing it wrong"". At that young age, I knew there was a better way to do this, I just didn't know what it was. My parents didn't have a college degree, so I put myself through an undergrad program at a private and reputable college and I then whent on to obtain a masters degree at Syracuse University. I wanted to do everything different than the example my parents and even my large mexican/irish family set for me. I was the first to get a college degree and the only one with a masters degree. I'm 46 and I've never been married and having children has never been a priority for me. My friends and family would describe me as a person makes things happen. I run a very successful design company (we design some really beautiful magazines). I'm considered successful. I love my job, and I have everything I need. My only debt are my college loans. And even now...Every visit home, I have at least one aunt or uncle or cousin ask me...""when are you going to get married or when are you going to have kids?"" 

My answer: I'm a person who goes after what I want. I've set goals for myself to go to college, be a good designer, a successful business woman and I have that. If I haven't gotten married, or had a baby, I'd say, that its not something I really want, its not my priority and never has been. If it were...I would have achieved it by now.

Just from babysitting a friend’s 2 year old for 6 hours, I was completely depleted of all energy. I believe I would be too strict, hard on my own children and with little patience, as I was raised with much structure and expectations. I am overly motherly – caring, concerned, looking after, consoling, advising, protective -  towards everyone (friends, family and even strangers), so I have dealt with enough ""children"" to want any of my own. When we are children, we are young and impressionable, additionally susceptible to misinterpret people and things that happen in our lives. I, myself, am addressing through therapy how the events of my past have formed my ways of thinking and reasons for the decision making. I also fear what the world and society will be like by the time I do ever have children. Influences, society, pressures and the world have shifted significantly from when I was younger and I do not believe it is for the better. I do not want the sole responsibility of raising a child. I do believe that ever person that comes across our path makes a difference, either in a small or large way. I truly believe I would be/ am a spectacular aunt – able to show the children the positive things in life, the fun, teach them things and maintaining structure and discipline. As a child gets older, I would be their confidant and able to speak of things they would be unable to share with their own parents through fear of judgment or criticism. I would be able to influence a person’s life, but without the added responsibility of raising them myself. ",

My parents divorced when I was 7 and my mom took full responsibility for me and my two brothers shortly thereafter when my dad lost the house I was born in and became homeless. My mother did such and incredible job providing for us and molding us into honest, compassionate people. I honestly do not think that I can do any better than she did for me.

5/6/2015 11:49:53,"I want to prioritize my career., I don’t like children., I don’t want the financial responsibility., I like my life as it is.","Marital Bliss: In today’s high paced world it is hard to find enough quality time with your spouse for dates, romance and intimacy; children make it nearly impossible. I value the amazing friendship I have with my husband and feel our relationship would suffer with the introduction of a child.  Pets: I feel extremely fortunate that I get such happiness from the love and devotion of animals. From the time I was a young child I connected with animals in a way that most people do not; understood their gestures, felt their pain and could communicate their needs. Our dogs do require a lot of work and attention, but at least I can throw up a baby gate and leave them at home for a few hours without child protective services knocking at my door.Freedom to Choose: Without children, there is the freedom to choose whatever you want to do, wherever you want to go, whoever you want to see, whatever you want to eat, etc. etc. etc. Eat dinner at 9 pm, no problem. Hop on a plane for a long weekend in Vegas, start packing. This spontaneity is a crucial piece of who I am which would disappear with children. Career Aspirations: Career advancement is limited when jumping out of the fast-lane and taking the Mommy Track, even a few months home these days can disrupt career advancement. I also appreciate that I work because I enjoy my job (most of the time!). If I wanted to change careers we could downsize our home and move to a less expensive neighborhood and make that happen. I’m not stuck in a job because my family is dependent on my salary to stay in a school district or a big house; that sounds vaguely like indentured servitude. Momfia: As if being a mother does not naturally come with its own set of pressure, “Super-Moms” impose additional guilt and punishment to mothers who forego breast-feeding, feed children non-organic meals, use diapers rather then natural elimination techniques, decide to go to work, decide to stay home, decide to put their kids in public school, decide to run a marathon 9 months after giving birth; and they do all this while maintaining a perfect figure, well manicured nails and a full face of makeup. Where's the Owner's Manual: Children do not come with an owners manual which could be a major reason so many people screw up their children. People think that childfree couples know nothing about children, but I argue that childfree couples are all too understanding of the complexities and commitment involved with raising a happy and healthy child who becomes an upstanding member of our society. Parenting is hard, tough, thankless, endless work and far too many people have children without understanding all it entails to be a good parent and role model. Gene Pool: Where others lament that my husband and I will not be bringing a tall, smart, blonde haired, blue eyed child into the world they neglect to remember the less glamorous genes we will not pass on; the world has enough overweight nerdy asthmatic angry alcoholics. Economic Stability: Studies report that raising the average child costs $1.2 million from birth to 18, not having them is my retirement plan. Children are a very high risk investment; historically they have very low ROI. The overall reason for my not having children equates to the risk and investment is not worth the intangible rewards. Gender Bias: If I could guarantee having a girl maybe I would consider it, but raising boys must be the hardest job in the world and I would be devastated to have a son. Return Policy: We often hear people say all our reasons for not having children will go away once they are born and we’ll change our priorities to make room for baby. What if that does not happen and the baby just doesn’t fit; hospitals will not take it back if you decide you don’t want it, even with a receipt. People do not want to believe that there are thousands upon thousands of parents who do not love their children the way they thought or want to change their priorities and it is the children who ultimately suffer. Guarantees: There is not a money-back guarantee that a child will grow up to be a human being you actually like, or who will like you. You can spend your 1.2 million dollars to raise a child and still dislike them or never see them as adults.  Warrantees: If babies are born with or develop any issues, they are not covered by an extended warranty; 1 in 56 children will develop autism, 5% of children are born with birth defects, childhood cancer is on the rise. Mathematically it seems that there is a very small chance of having a perfectly healthy child. Boredom: Constantly having to read the same books, talk in mono-syllabic words and follow a small human around is my personal definition of hell. If you are lazy, you can just throw your children in front of the television 8 hours a day, but then Barney, Dora and Blues Clues rot out their brains while causing parents to want to blow out theirs. Family Ties: How do parents living hundreds of miles away from any support network maintain their sanity? My family lives over 1000 miles away. Without grandparents and aunts living in a 10 mile radius to rescue the child from a stress induced murderous rampage I would likely end up in jail and the children would grow up without the love of an extended network of family. Paternal Role: Couples can say until they are blue in the face that they equally share parental responsibilities but the truth of the matter is the brunt of the burden falls squarely on the shoulders of the mother; it all starts with the birth and continues from there. The only way a women can remain equal to men in both the home and the workplace is to forego motherhood. No Basic Instincts: Where many other women coo at babies, love shopping for onesies, and talk lovingly of “the baby smell,” I actually find babies and all the things that go with them slightly repulsive with not the slightest bit of natural maternal instincts. Human Incubator: Many women with children who chose not to breast feed give “not wanting to feel like a milking cow” as a reason behind the decision. How those women feel about breast feeding is how I feel about the entire pregnancy; everything involved in carrying a child is far too functional and utilitarian for my comfort. You think science would develop a much better method for bringing babies into the world rather then relying on women to serve as fetus feeders destroying their bones and figures. Overpopulation: If you think gas prices are high, the earth is warming and the world is just becoming too crowded try squeezing another billion or two onto the planet. Many argue that having children is necessary to the survival of the human race but having too many children will eventually lead to our demise. Minivans: As if this needs any explanation.

I like living my life knowing that I WILL make mistakes and maybe end up some place I don't like, but ultimately being able to think things over and finding a way back on a comfortable, or more fulfilling track. For people who think life is a series of achievements, a child is something you MUST HAVE (sadly, they sometimes even think of it in terms of owing one's children) in order to move up that ladder. I like to think of life as the journey itself, one which will end owing nothing, preferably not being attached to anything.",

5/6/2015 12:15:11,I don’t want the financial responsibility.,"I grew up one of four children with middle class parents who had to work two jobs to make ends meet.  All three of my siblings have children and all three of them are struggling to survive and provide for their kids.  Two of them are single parents and have to rely on support from the Government and our parents.  I could never imagine putting that burden on my parents.  With child care costs in Massachusetts being among the highest in the country, it doesn't make any financial sense (to me) to have a child of my own.  Also, I have an incredibly fulfilling life without children full of opportunities to pursue hobbies, interests and travel.  Something my sibling are not able to enjoy.  I love being the cool, fun Auntie.  My nieces and nephews are the light of my life and I'm happy to be able to provide them support and opportunities their parents are not able to.  ",
5/6/2015 12:15:48,"I don’t like children., I don’t want the financial responsibility., I like my life as it is.","I simply have never wanted a child, could never picture myself as a mother, never had the drive or the urge. Having a child is such a huge responsibility that it should only be undertaken by people who truly want this and are preparing for it. People who don't want to become parents, or those who are 'on the fence' should not do it. There is too much at stake. 

In times when an average twenty-something graduates with thousands of dollars worth of debt, and can only hope for a mediocre job, having children is becoming a luxury. My husband and I can barely support ourselves with two full time, decent-paying jobs. I can't even imagine how we would survive with another mouth to feed.

Lastly, we like our lives as they are, the freedom to do what we want, sleep in, have peaceful and quiet evenings. We don't do well in loud, noisy environments or on less then 7 hours of sleep. When I hear what most parents go through, it seems like a torture. The benefits just don't seem to be worth it to us. 

If I can add a bit of my own opinion to this piece, I think that people should realize that having children should not be the standard, but just another option. Do people not realize how much work and sacrifice goes into raising another life? Why would they assume that everyone wants/is able to take on such a huge responsibility? Perhaps if all children were wanted and well cared for, this world would look a little different...but this is a utopia I'm referring to, isn't it?",

Some people have children to feel less lonely. Some people have children as a result of an accident. Some people have children because they want somebody to help them out when they're older.

Kids covered in snot, food, or worse are disgusting, not cute. I don't care about their ramblings. I don't find them to be ""honest"" so much as rude/cruel because they haven't learned empathy yet. 

I love animals and have 2 cats. My wife and I have discussed this and are in agreement that we will not be parents. She is open to the idea of one, but respects that it is not an option with me. Having or wanting children is a dealbreaker for me when it comes to dating. 

I find it hard to have good relationships with some parents because they seem to lose their identities. All they ever talk about is their kids. Even when you ask how THEY are, often the response is about the kids, not them. I find it a little horrifying to be honest. Especially when they try to convert you---like this is some sort of cult. 

More than anything, I hate the notion that there is something wrong with not wanting to be a parent. People try to convince you otherwise. They accuse you of being selfish or that you must have had an abusive childhood. Worst of all are the people who dismiss your decisions based on your age. 

I'd been campaigning for sterilization since I was 18. No doctor would take me seriously because I was too young and might change my mind. When I turned 30, I'd have enough. It was a fight, but I convinced my doctor to give me an ablation to treat my chronic periods. He tried the ""it's a permanent decision"" argument, but I was well-armed for that. I told him that becoming a parent was also a permanent decision. If I had come in there to discuss becoming a pregnant, he would have never questioned my age or my choice. Therefore, his argument was ignorant and unfounded. I was either old enough to make decisions about my health and life, or I was not. He could not have it both ways.

5/6/2015 13:58:01,"I don’t like children., I don’t want the financial responsibility., I like my life as it is.","I have NEVER wanted to be a mother; even as a little girly my dolls were never my “babies”.  I was always their teacher, babysitter, etc.
As an adult, I just don’t like children very much.  I don’t get them.  I like things to be neat, orderly, and quiet.  That doesn’t seem to happen around kids.  I know that sounds selfish, but it’s the truth.
Less selfish reasons include the fear of what I might be passing on to any children I might have.  There are quite a few major mental health issues that are prevalent in my family, and also in my husband’s family.  It seems likely that those are genetic, so it seems a bit like playing Russian Roulette for us to have a child.  
Continuing that line of thought, one of my maternal great grandfathers was a pedophile.  If there’s even a chance that’s something that’s a result of Nature not Nurture then the sooner our genes die off the better, in my opinion.
My husband and I both do a lot of volunteer work, and I think that would be drastically reduced if we had a child.  There are only 24 hours in a day, after all.  I think we’d also fight, a lot, if we had a child.  We were raised in households that were basically polar opposites, and as a result of that we have very differing opinions on what constitutes good and bad parenting.  
Back to less serious reasons, I like my life the way it is.  I like my quiet time, I like sleeping all night long, and I like not having to be responsible for getting another person ready in the morning.     
I think it’s better to know and admit that I don’t need to be a mother than it would be to have a child because it’s expected and end up being a terrible mother.

I don't yearn to be pregnant, long to be a mother, or dream of the day where small little feet will wake me up on early Saturday mornings. 

If having a child isn't something that I truly want, then why do it? I was in a long term relationship with a man who wanted children, and looking back, if we had stayed together, I would probably have a child by now. Not because I wanted it, but because I loved him so much I would have sacrificed my wishes for his. How long would have been before I resented him and my new child?

My current live in boyfriend has children. The two youngest still live at home but they are both in High School. I often joke that it's motherhood without all having to deal with all of the tiring early years. But I'm not their mother, I do cook, and take them to events and schedule dr.s appointments, etc. Helping him out with the teenagers is one things, but it makes it more and more evident in my mind that gestating, birthing, and raising a child is not nor will ever be something I want to do.

Its happening to me right now. Realistically, i dont see the point of bringing a human into this world intentionally. I dont think there is a logical reason for doing that. Why would i want to bring another human into the world just so they can possibly suffer bullying, shaming, sadness, anger, heartbreak, frustration, loss and many more unfortunate negative emotions. Without feeling the worst of something a person can not recognize the best of something. Regardless, why would i purposely bring a human into the world thats going to suffer through something bad regardless. He/she will go to school, grow up, do adult things or whatever it is that it wants to do and live the cycle of life that everyone is bound to live as soon as they are born but for what exactly? For no reason whatsoever. I hate it when people tell me ""you dont know if he/she will make a difference in the world."" My response is that no i dont know but if its not my child its going to be someone else's child that makes that difference. All will be ok in the world if it doesnt have one more human to populate this world. I cant imagine purposely bringing a child into a world like this. I absolutely despise and resent parents. I still somewhat respect good parents for wanting to have kids and the ones that try their best to take care of them but i also think parents are extremely selfish and condemn them for being so. I dont have sympathy for parents (who intentionally have kids) at all. I didnt make you get pregnant, i didnt make you have the child so why should sympathize towards you or your children? Or think you are any better than me? I have also met many married men who feel stuck in miserable marriages with no way out because they dont want to be ""the father that walked out on the kids."" They go through their fatherly and husbandly motions and keep a straight face when in reality their kids are the only thing(s) keeping them from putting a gun to their mouth because thats how miserable they are with their marriage. This goes for wives as well. There are alot of women who stay in relationships for the same reason. I would never wish that upon anyone. Im not saying i will have a perfect life without kids but at least i wont selfishly be bringing a human into a world of suffering and that will always keep my conscience clear. The cute pregnancy outfits and baby outfits for facebook and instagram really isnt worth a life time of suffering for a human that didnt even ask to come into this world. ",

5/6/2015 16:08:00,"I want to prioritize my career., I don’t like children., I have a bad relationship with my parents., I don’t want the financial responsibility., I like my life as it is.","These answers aren't quite in line with my thoughts, so I'll try to break it down in point form:

- I want to prioritize my LIFE, not just my career. I don't know where I'll be 5 or 10 years from now. I don't have a plan for myself in that sense, but I like to keep doors open.
- I like children, but not on a level which makes me want my own. I am mildly uncomfortable around children of some ages, since I don't know how I should interact with them...
- I don't have a ""bad"" relationship with my parents, but I do have one that I think doesn't naturally lead me to want to parent. We are on good terms, but not ""close"" in an overly-loving way.
- More than the financial burden, I just simply do not want to the burden of having someone else's life in my hands. That old ""I can barely take care of myself"" adage...
- I do like my life as it is. I like being child-free.

Others:
- I have no desire to pass on my genetics.
- As I get older, the world confuses, infuriates and scares me more... I don't think this is singular to this moment in history - but with so much unrest, I don't like the idea of bringing someone else into the world.
- Over-population is a serious concern (this IS specific to this moment in history) and our resources are growing more and more scarce... not everyone should feel like they ""have"" to have children.
- Everything about being pregnant and giving birth horrifies me.
- Put simply: I have never had a ""maternal instinct"" in the sense that I have never wanted kids. I can be protective of those around me that I love, but this does not extend to an urge for having my own offspring. I felt this way at 10 years old, when girlfriends of mine would discuss on the playground how many kids they'd like to have in the future; I continue to feel this way at nearly 30-years old. Everyone had told me over and over ""you'll change your mind!"" I have not. I have felt the same way through every relationship I have been in and at every moment of my life, including the past year, which has seen many of my close friends begin to have children. I am happy for everyone who wants a child and has one, but they aren't for me. It'd be nice if more people were happy for me in my decision...

I've never felt that way. There was a time I got caught up in baby fever when all my friends were having their first kids, but that passed after a year or so.
During that time I realized that I never had the inclination to be a mom, but I wanted badly to make my husband a father.

Then my second epiphany happened, while trying to conceive, I was doing all the work, the timing, the planning, the worrying. My husband was not interested in discussing or preparing and I thought, ""what am I doing this for?"" I'll have to leave my job for a year who knows what I'll come back to, when I go back to work who wants to leave their one-year old, much less with a stranger? My whole pay cheque will go to daycare, we're pay cheque to pay cheque now how will we afford another person? My husband will compare our kid to his brother's kid, we can't compete. I struggle with my body as it is, this will make it so much worse. My husband has all the love in the world to give, but has no clue what this will actually entail. I want to travel and be spontaneous won't have the time or money. And all my friends? They clearly love their kids...and have nothing positive to say about parenting. 

I have to say I have never once felt judged for not wanting kids. I sincerely believe life with kids and without kids are both AMAZING roads to travel. And I'm happy with my choice.

I'd watched too many friends &/or acquaintances manage suprise pregnancies & I wanted to avoid finding myself in that situation.  For a time I had a partner that I could actually imagine procreating with...but partnerships can be challening & as our's changed my desire to have babies with him changed.  We would have had beautiful babies.

As I entered my mid-thirties I really started to evaluate if in fact I'd always wanted to have babies of if I had just been socially conditioned to think I'd always wanted babies...becausse, you know, that's what women do....it's how you know you are of value & being a woman ""right"".  That whole ""biological"" clock business...I hadn't heard so much as a tick (& still haven't)....so it must not be time just yet.  There was never any presure from my parents to ""give them grandchildren"" & as time move on I became less & less attached to the idea of having children.  Additionally, my ideas about nurturing and motherhood evolved & I realized that if I ever felt so moved as to be a mother, I can love a child...the child does not have to be from my body for me to love them...so any lingering sense of ergency disappeared.

I guess the funny thing is...I don't really feel like I've made a choice not to have children..I have just never felt compelled to persue becoming a parent.  I feel compelled to travel, to laugh & cry with my friends, to spend time with my family, to garden, to dance, to do so many things but being a parent has not been one of them.

I love my life, I don't feel like I'm missing out on something because I haven't had a child.  I don't think that my life would be more fulfilling or meaningful if I had a child.  I don't feel the need to see a little me running around (it actually seems kind of vain & selfish to me considering the state of the world regarding population/resources...but that is a completely different converstation.)

I could go on & on about this topic...mostly because I am at the age where everyone feels it is thier responsibility to point out that my ""window of opportunity "" is rapily closing & I'll regret it if I don't do it.  

Yeah, that's not a compelling enough arguement to alter the next 20 years of my life....because I ""might"" regret it?  I've made it this far with out regretting it :)

I love them dearly but that does't mean I have to have some of my own. My brother and sister both have kids, I'm very close to my cousins which some have kids and others on the way so I get to be an extension to them as some form or another, a mom. 

And the fact that I get to do that, to have that honor, to be able to be so closely in their lives is pretty amazing. But again it doesn't mean I have to have some of my own. 

I get a glimpse into the responsibility, worrying, fears and constant wondering of what they ate, if they slept enough, how was their day at school. I barely get to check in with myself let alone another human being I am responsible for bringing up into the world.

My Mother was brutal, and my Father was distant and critical.  Their own relationship lasted until my Mother's death only because of old-fashioned obligation.  Mom screamed at Dad every single night of my life.  He was dismissive.  They did not enjoy each other at all.  Control issues were used by both parents against each other as well as against the children.  Mom's disatisfaction in life was taken out on two of her four children, destroying confidence and leading to codependence. Mom would rant about how horrible it was being a Mother with all the worries and responsibilities.  ""Once you are a Mom, you are always a Mom"" took on a menacing tone.  We were not allowed to make our own choices in life.  She would tell relatives or anybody who would listen, that there was something ""wrong"" with us.  I was one of those disliked children. When I left home, I finally discovered that not only did people accept me as rational & likeable, professors referred to me as gifted.  I graduated from one of the top 10 Universities in the US and was successful in two retail businesses, my independent proprietorship and my own private corporation.  I still spent many years in lengthy relationships  with mentally abusive partners.  At 36, I finally bloomed.  I knew myself and my strengths.  I knew what to expect in love.  I became pregnant with twins by accident (with condom), and was afraid I would pass on my Mother's terrible lessons.  I had a huge support system by then and was almost convinced I could raise a child properly when I lost ""them"" due to partial molar pregnancy.  I was both destroyed and relieved.  My love relationship did not withstand the tragedy.  The doctor insisted I not get pregnant for 2 years, to avoid misunderstanding the symptoms of pregnancy as cell growth from the partial molar pregnancy, which could kill me if not detected soon enough. By the time I was able to ""try"" again I was already 40, which did not seem safe.  I am left feeling the mysterious loss of children I never knew & the unknown love and relationships I may have developed.  In contrast to that very deep loss, somehow I feel I should not have a child.  I simply didn't have a confident and mature way of looking at the world early enough in life to be a good Mother.

I have been full time nanny now for over 7 years and am finishing a teaching credential. I am 37 now and after having the honor of being inside peoples lives on a daily basis, I have come to realize that I really like my peace and quiet. I have not ruled out potentially being a foster parent to older children in the future. But I don't forsee myself having children of my own. Additionally, I have endometriosis, and although it is not impossible to get pregnant naturally, the chances are pretty slim, and with my age I am unwilling to take the chance at this point. 

I want a marriage that offers connection, partnership, the means to enjoy life to the fullest, and plenty of time to play. Unfortunately having children realistically puts an immense amount of stress on relationships. For me, I had a very difficult, dramatic and stressful childhood and young adulthood. I am enjoying the peace I have now found in my 30's. 

Lastly, looking toward the very near future I will be in the classroom with children everyday. I feel like the best gift I can give to my students is to be rested, supported and have a home life that encourages and fosters peace, personal growth and joy so I can suit up and show up and give 150% to each of my students each day.

I’m more stable in my career, but I’m still not close to home.  Additionally, I don’t really have any desire to have kids (35 years old).  I don't have any desire to change my lifestyle to accommodate being responsible for taking kids to/from school, doctor's appointments, etc.  Some people say that I should just give in and have kids.  That desire will follow.  I doubt that. I tend to follow the theory that the decision to have kids is equivalent to the decision to get a face tattoo.  There’s no room for doubt.  If you’re going to go for it, you better be all in from the beginning.  I’m not all in.

Do I regret having not having kids?  Nope.  If I had kids, I don't think I would have been able to job hop and take some of the opportunities that I've taken.  

Kids are expensive.  I like spending my money on me and my husband.  Raising kids today is hard.  People are so quick to judge you and point out your flaws – often online or to authorities, rarely to your face.  What if I have a kid and that kid turns out to be a jerk, sociopath, or murder?  No thanks.  What if that kid is too much for me to handle?  No thanks.  What if that kid is sweet, innocent, and loving and I can’t promise them a future that’s equally sweet and loving?  No thanks.  

If – big if – I change my mind, I’d look into adoption, foster care, or being a Big Sister.  There’s a lot of kids out there who need love.  I’d rather help one of those kids than be selfish just to create one that shares my DNA.

I also greatly dislike children, I didn't even like them when I was a child. If I was at a play date , I would ditch the child to go hang out with their pets. 

My husband is religious  and I am not, a child would cause a huge rift between us because he would want to brainwash the child with church and I am staunchly  against children being forced into organized religion.

A baby should always be wanted by their parents, parents who are emotionally, physically  and financially prepared for a child. It is much better to consider the option of child rearing and to opt out because it is not right for you, versus  just mindlessly jumping on the baby bandwagon.  There is no trial membership with parenting, children do not come with return policies.  Some people find this out much to late and end up pining for the life they had and abusing the child who never asked to be born. An abused child will either die at the hands of their parents, grow up emotionally disturbed or will be placed into foster care, becoming just a product of the state. None of this is fair to the child.    If  a person really  evaluates  what is important to them and are honest about what they can handle it would save a lot of  heart ache.

We are harming our mother earth and soon we will reach a brink that we cannot return from; I do not want to subject any child or grandchild of mine to the future destruction they'd witness when the planet no longer has resources to support mankind.
Then there is the moral standpoint, the ""way people are"", if you will. I am an American, born and raised. I was raised in southeastern Pennsylvania in the 90s and early 2000s, and I was the last of a generation where it was considered somewhat safe to play outside alone. Kidnappings were fewer, mentally ill people who posed threat to others were fewer, and the news didn't contain half of the horrifyining things that it does today. I would not let any child of mine frollic about outside on their own until their teens in this day and age. There are too many people who pose threats to them for me to feel comfortable; my mother didn't have to worry like I would today. This world is a strange, new place, and I want no parts of bringing a child into a world where fellow classmates torture and kill classmates over internet make believe, children are no longer free from bullying after school ceases due to social media interraction, and the classmates of my children, many of which would be far lesser behaved than my standard of parenting due to today's ""me-me-me, I'm entitled"" mentality, would be rubbing off on them, regardless of how well I parent my own children.
To everyone who has children, best of luck to you and yours, and I personally love kids; my two year old nephew is my best buddy. But I will never have children of my own. I would love to get a tubal ligation, but current societal stigma prevents that from being an option to me.",

5/7/2015 12:19:42,I like my life as it is.,"Dear Huffington Post, 
I am writing in response to your survey for women not interested in having children. 

I have read several articles on the topic over the years and was intrigued by the opportunity to contribute to the conversation. 
However, I must share that I was surprised by your survey choices. 
Many of the listed options echoed the same stale sentiments that I regularly hear from family, friends, and even strangers when they learn about my present choice to not have children: career-oriented, must hate kids, must have had a terrible upbringing…

These reasons, or the fact that there needs to a reason why a woman doesn’t want children (despite being the leader and advocate of her own life and choices), has always been baffling to me. I am 28 years old and for the majority of these 28 years, I have been aware that I do not want to have kids. Let me follow-up with that statement with my usual disclaimer: I love kids! I’ve been a nanny and babysitter and while they’re testing at times (who isn’t occasionally annoyed by a crying baby), I would describe myself as warm and nurturing. I love my parents, I am not and do not plan to be married to my job, and I am not a pretentious cold-hearted ice-queen. I simply just do not see myself having children. 

For me, there was a moment of confusion growing-up when I was struck with this feeling of discomfort imagining myself as a mother. The image just didn’t feel right to me. I was distressed at this realization! What happens now? I thought I had to continue down that path because having children is what women do. I asked myself, ‘how do I continue building a life I don’t want?!’ 

Navigating my future plans as childless despite it being against the assumed norm has not always been easy. It took me time to become comfortable and then confident with the decision to not have children. Not because I was unsure but primarily because I was wary of reactions from others. And it has been met with various responses and assumptions, both positive and negative. But the most common I hear is simply “you’ll change your mind”. This statement is especially frustrating to me. I feel it implies that their perspective is right and I am wrong, naïve, flighty and not ready to be burdened with even the concept of having a child. But when I find the right husband or mature a bit I’ll “be ready”. 

Yes, I’m 28...fairly young in the grand scheme of things. But I assure you, I am far from immature or naïve. And I am aware this decision will affect my serious dating prospects and next steps as I plan my own adult future. As I approach 30, with many of my friends settling-down and starting families, I think about my own path and remain happy with my decision. 

Sometimes a coworker or acquaintance will say “when you have kids…” or a related sentiment in passing and it might make me feel a bit awkward, perhaps similar to how someone in a same sex relationship reacts when another references their assumed husband or wife. But, it’s not a decision I advertise or a conversation I want to indulge so I simply nod and smile and let it go. Because frankly, it’s none of their business. And in my opinion, the reasons that women decide not to have children really shouldn’t be as significant of a topic as it is. 

Some people live in the suburbs, some in the city. Some women like to wear high heels or flats, or date older or younger men, or straighten their hair or leave it curly. These are mundane examples of how we live our lives that people tend to have a lot of opinions on. But to me, choosing to have or not have children is just that: another lifestyle choice. So I will wear my heels and leave my hair curly and chose right now not to want children regardless of public opinion or stigmas of childless women. 

And maybe I will change my mind or maybe I won’t. But it will be my choice to make without an explanation because it shouldn’t be required. 

In conclusion, I suppose I what I am trying to say is that I really couldn’t find the right option to click on the survey you provided. 
Might I recommend adding a box that simply says: “just not for me""?

First the biggest thing is just the thought of being pregnant sounds completely horrible and I want nothing to do with that entire process. My father also had a mentally and physically handicapped cousin who was about the same age as him. When I was a child I used to go over there with my grandparents to help my great aunt take care of him after my great uncle passed away. She was in here 60s and still taking care of her son in his 40s who was like a giant child, and confined to his bed or wheelchair all day. That completely terrified me that I could end up with a child that would never be able to grow up and leave, and I'd never have my life back. They ended up dying in the nursing home together. I also just don't really like kids that much in general, even the ones that are kind of cute. I love my nieces and nephews when I see them, once in a while, for a couple hours, and then they go home. I can deal with being the cool aunt, having them 24/7 would not be for me. I don't have the patience, and I think I'd be a terrible parent. I also have a demanding job, with long hours, I can't even imagine how I would take care of a child while working 5 or 6 12 hour days a week. My boyfriend of almost 7 years works just as much, who would be raising a kid in this relationship? Neither of us wants to give up our careers. I also don't want the financial responsibility, kids are expensive, I'm still trying to pay off my student loans, I can't afford a kid too. Though if I had one than I'd get all kids of tax breaks and stuff, so maybe, but I also don't want to rely on welfare or anything like that to get by. It bothers me a lot that so many people just have kids with no plan and no way to pay for them and than expect the government to bail them out and support them. This world has too many stupid people in it, less of them breeding would be ideal, sadly it's the smarter ones that usually choose not too.

I do enjoy the company of some children, my nephew for instance, but for shorter periods of time. I am unable to emotionally handle the stress of being around children for more than a few hours. When this limit is exceeded I find myself severely stressed, anxious, in a generally sour mood, and unable to focus or complete tasks.

As previously stated, I am not one to take on full time care and responsibility of another individual if I cannot handle it emotionally. I don't see parenthood as worth the loss of my emotional stability and happiness. 

My career is important to me, although I don't believe this is one of my main priorities for not having children. 

Other reasons I have for not having children relate to environmental consiousness.

If I announced a pregnancy no one would even think to tell me that I would change my mind. At 26, no one would tell me I was too young to know for sure. People would celebrate that announcement.

Despite that fact that childfree women and couples are becoming more and more common, it's still a thing that's treated very strangely by most people - even complete strangers feel they have the right to join the conversation if they overhear things.

Why, when I can make all sorts of life changing, serious decisions, am I not granted agency over my own decision making in this particular matter?

I can understand why my boyfriend's mother might contest it - as long as we stay together I'm disrupting her dream of having grandchildren. But a random person on FB who saw a post I shared on a like-minded friend's wall? What reason could they have for being offended at my personal, definitely none-of-their-business decision?

To be honest, not having kids has never been a decision for me. It's just a thing I've always known. I never reached a crux where I realized ""Hey, maybe I don't want kids."" I just knew. I didn't realize how unusual that was until I was in college. But many people do actively make a decision about not having kids. They believe their finances won't support children. They don't think they'd be good parents. They don't think their lifestyle is conducive the young kids. They decide that a family history of disease and health problems isn't worth passing on. Their parents were abusive and they don't want to continue the cycle. Whatever the reason, it's a personal decision. And yet, people will constantly ask you to justify that decision.

If I walked up to strangers with children (or even friends!) and asked them to justify their decision to bring kids into the world I'd be considered at least rude and intrusive, if not worse. But it's 100% socially okay to bombard someone who's chosen not to have children with questions about why. Over time I have become pretty adept at reeling off all my reasons:

   - I don't want them. 
   - I've never felt maternal instincts.
   - I don't live or anticipate ever living a wealthy lifestyle. I don't think I could support kids, and/or I wouldn't be willing to give up things I enjoy in order to support kids.
   - In that vein, I'm unwilling to give up time spent on activities I enjoy to support kids.
   - Crying babies give me severe anxiety.
   - I think babies are gross.
   - Pregnant women freak me out.
   - Seriously, have you seen pregnant bellies?
   - I have significant concerns about the physical effects of pregnancy on my body.
   - I have significant concerns about the emotional effects of pregnancy on my brain.
   - A number of family members have histories with mental health. I am concerned about the kinds of things I might pass on to a child.
   - I suffer from a number of physical health problems. I would not want to pass them on to a child and they might take away from my ability to care for a child.
   - I was lucky that my father was able to help pay for my college tuition with the help of some scholarships. I could not offer the same for a child and personally would not feel comfortable asking a child to pay for that on their own in this economy.
   - I want to travel a lot. I enjoy high risk sports such as horseback riding. I am a writer by profession. I don't think any of these lifestyle choices are (for me personally) conducive to raising children - especially combined. I am unwilling to give any of them up.
   - I don't feel morally okay with bringing more children into a world that has orphanages full of kids who need homes. 

People like to combat a lot of those responses with things like ""But you could/should adopt!"" or (the ever faithful) ""You'll change your mind!"" or - my favorite -""You won't know unless you try!"" Because if I try having kids and don't like it I can take advantage of the well known ""No-backsies"" rule, right?

Another response I hear a lot: ""It doesn't matter if you think you don't like kids. It's different when they're related to you!"" I have a niece and a much younger sister from my dad's remarriage. They are currently both 5 years old and delightful. I love them. I babysit, I play with them, I spend time with them. I read them books when they're going to bed and buy them more books as holiday and birthday presents. I run around with them in the mud and chase fireflies. And all that is great, but I still really enjoy giving them back to their parents at the end of the day.

I have a lot of respect for people who choose to have kids and give it all they've got. There's no 100% correct way to be a parent and no one is perfect, but it shows when you really love your kid and do the best you can. Parents have to give up a lot of themselves to be there for their kids. I have a lot of respect for parents because giving up that much of my self and my time is not something I'm willing or interested in doing.

Something it took me an embarrassingly long time to figure out: I don't need to justify my reasons.

That first bullet point - ""I don't want them"" - is more than enough.

Innumerable children are in need of better homes, permanent homes, or any home at all. Any effort spent trying to persuade someone who doesn't want to bring more kids into the world that they're wrong is misplaced. And me? I have agency over my own body and mind and I don't owe anyone an explanation for the choices I've made.

So, if I owe no explanation, then why am I writing this? Because the number of people who don't want children is growing but it's still hard to find the voices of like minded people. Because I'm sad to find myself starting to feel bitter each time someone asks for a breakdown of my reasons.

Not having children is not a selfish decision. It's a deeply personal choice. Much like the decision to have kids, it's a choice that can only be made on an individual level. The decision to have children can be a beautiful, happy, loving choice. The decision not to have children can also be a beautiful, happy, and loving choice.

I'd like for like-minded people to know they're not alone. I also hope that this might give some insight to those who haven't been able to understand why someone might choose not to have kids.

And if all that doesn't reach some part of your heart and convince you to try and make childfree women have kids - consider this: There are many women who do want to have kids, but are unable to. They may suffer through miscarriages, infertility treatments, and a mess of emotions I can't even begin to fathom. And every time you ask why someone doesn't have children you are risking dredging all of that up for someone.

So the next time someone answers ""No"" when you ask if they have children, consider saying ""Good for you"" and moving on....Without asking why or pontificating.",

1.  It's incredibly unethical to create more people in a world that is already drastically overpopulated.  (And, contrary to popular belief, this situation isn't just about food -- it's also about water and whether we're drowning in our own garbage.)  We should make sure we have quality of life covered for people who are already here before we make even more!  

2.  I have zero interest in the physical suffering related to pregnancy, childbirth, or their aftereffects.  I suffer enough for getting stuck with a uterus already, between endometriosis and ovarian cysts.  

3.  I'm the eldest of four children.  I already spent years babysitting for no pay, having no personal space, listening to babies cry, changing diapers, watching Disney movies on repeat, and being put last.  It is not fun.  It is not enjoyable.  It is not rewarding.  Why would I subject myself to all that and worse?  

4.  I resent the whole idea that as a woman, the only way I can be ""complete"" or ""successful"" is through an act of self-abnegation and erasure so total that I would cease to be seen as anything but ""so-and-so's mother"" for the rest of my life.  

5.  I am deeply troubled by the lack of youth human rights in our country.  As an adult, I have freedom of speech, freedom of religion, access to medical care (like vaccines), and the right to vote.  I can leave an abuser.  I cannot be subjected to arbitrary restrictions on my time and movement, like discriminatory curfew laws.  Bringing a child into this situation, even if I wanted one, would be like kidnapping a woman and forcing her to live in Iran or Saudi Arabia, where she's more like property than a person.  It wouldn't feel right to do that to someone.  Lord knows it bothered me as a kid and teenager.  

I do not, contrary to many people's beliefs, have a bad relationship with my parents, hate children (I volunteer with them), or think primarily about money.  I'm not a workaholic with a high-powered career.  (My god, that list of options reads like a Primer for Stereotyping the Childfree.)  To debunk a few others: This decision was well-thought-out over many years, and I am not going to change my mind.  It is not a source of conflict in my marriage.  I'm not shallow and vain about my appearance, nor do I live in a white-carpeted house with no tolerance for clutter.  I don't consider my pets my children.  I admire people who adopt and foster children that are already here (well, at least if they do a good job.)  I believe in a strong K-12 education system and in making sure kids have decent food, good books, and opportunities.  I think we should treat kids with respect and include them...but also that it is reasonable to have some age-differentiated spaces for adults to spend time together (like bars and late movies).  ",

I don't think people realized that before all those ""mommy"" posts on social media. They made children just because ""that's what people do"". Back in the old days, reproducing was just a given, because of little to no access to birth control, and for population renewal. People died like flies in wars or in childbirth. Peasants needed arms for the land, and royalty needed to perpetuate the bloodline. But in this day and age where most of us work for big corporations or governments, children are an expense, not an investment. They are basically very expensive hairless pets. Also, I am afraid of having an autistic or otherwise heavily handicapped child. I know the odds are small, but even the smallest odd is enough to make me renounce motherhood. But, most important reason of all: I have zero affinity with babies and small children. Either they annoy me and make me want to run away from the room or, in the best of cases, make me indifferent. But when I see a dog, that's another story. ;-)",
5/7/2015 14:01:05,"I have a bad relationship with my parents., I don’t want the financial responsibility., I like my life as it is.","I don't want to have kids for a few reasons.  One being I don't have the patience to be a parent.  Parenting takes a lot of dedication and that's something I'm not willing to give.  As I've grown older, I've realized that I need to be a mother to myself instead due to things I've gone through as a child and teenager.  

I rather be patient with myself and be dedicated to my own healing.  Besides, I wouldn't be much of a parent if I didn't heal myself.  I know what it's like to be on the receiving end of abuse from a person who never healed their pain.  Despite this, people would say that I'm selfish and mean it in a negative way.  I would say that I'm exercising a positive type of selfishness that is needed.  

Another reason would be that I'm an introvert.  I need time alone, and I need space.  I also like the independence being child-free gives me.  I like to do what I want, when I want, how I want without having to be concerned about how it will affect a child.  I'm also child-free because it's too heavy a financial burden.  I recently found out that it costs about $245,000 to raise ONE kid.  That's the cost of a house!

I just can't see myself spending that type of cash on a kid.  Besides, I have student loan debt to pay off.  Why make life more difficult than it already is by adding a kid?  It's just plain irresponsible.  Another reason is that I don't want to add to the overpopulation problem.  Unfortunately, some people act like the world was created for them and have forgotten that there are other forms of life living here with us.  If we wouldn't want to be pushed out of our homes and driven to extinction, why do that to other species?  Seriously, where is the compassion?  Ever wish that the world wasn't a cruel place?  Start with yourself and be compassionate.

Another reason is that I don't have a biological clock ticking away at me.  Even as a child, I never envisioned my life as one who is married with kids.  I don't understand the need to pass on the genes.  I guess it's a biological thing.  Further, I find the idea rather pedestrian, and I think that I would lose interest very quickly.  My life isn't Indiana Jones level exciting or anything, but I think if I was raised with the idea that being a wife and mother was to be my primary aim, I would eventually kill myself.  

And I would do it because deep down inside, when I shut out the noise of everybody telling me how they think my life should be and who they think I should be, I know that I was meant for so much more.  For me, parenting isn't enough.  Not by a long shot.  If it's enough for someone else, that's their business and I respect that.  But that should never be the standard for everyone, especially not for women.  

And I say that because, for what seems like forever, women have been told that we can't be anything more than a breeder, basically.  We've been told that we don't deserve anything better and that we can't achieve anything better.  We've been treated like we have no other desires or needs, and we've been told what we should feel, want, and need.  We're not treated as human beings, but things, machines to be used, abused, owned, and controlled.

I realize that not every woman has experienced that, but some still do.  And the idea of us being attacked, especially by other women, for choosing to be child-free is disappointing, to say the least.",

I don't handle stress well and have suffered from bad anxiety for years now.  I don't feel like I could put my child's needs first because I have to work hard to take care of my own well-being.  Kids are ridiculously expensive and I feel like they don't appreciate all of the support that their parents give to them.

We now live in a world full of entitlement and I cannot understand why people would wnat to bring a child in to today's world.  I also cannot understand why people are so selfish as to bring children into a world where there are already so many children who need loving homes, but cannot find them because people want to procreate and have babies with their own DNA instead of help the children who are already here.  It is sad.  Our world is already overpopulated, and I refuse to contribute to the deterioration of our environment.  I live a wonderful life.

I am happily married, working in a career I enjoy, and own a home that I worked for and never want to leave.  With so much I enjoy in my life, I've never felt a need to have children. This is probably because I've never felt my life lacking in any way.  When I think of having kids, I realize I'd have to sacrifice a lot of what I love in my life.  For example, I have a yoga room in my house.  I know that'd need to go if we had a baby.  My hours at work are not ideal for having children so finding childcare would be almost impossible.  Lastly, my husband and I are both busy enough with our own lives as it is.  I'm sure adding a baby would only chip away at our intimacy.  

Also, I enjoy the financial freedom that comes without having children.  I like being able to eat out frequently, shop, buy organic, get massages, and have a nice little chunk of change in the bank.  

Most importantly, I have to say that I love the quiet.  Whenever I'm around small children, I feel anxious.  There is just so much noise and chaos.  I often times see parents in restaurants, airports, even the grocery store, and amazed at the stress of getting children where they need to go.  The endless amount of bags, snacks, diapers, bottles, etc would make me feel too encumbered. My life is quiet, I enjoy my routine, I like my house to be tidy, and I just couldn't imagine intentionally signing up for something so stressful.  ",

I do like children, but I prefer the role of Aunt to the role of Mother.
My relationship with my parents is fine.
While children are expensive, the financial responsibility isn't the factor that made me decide not to have them.

Having, or not having, children is a lifestyle choice. Whether or not people want to admit it, children change your life -- and neither choice is good or bad or better than the other. 

Too often, people who choose not to have children are accused of running away from responsibility, being selfish, or being emotionally broken. We're made to feel like there's something wrong with us because we don't feel compelled to procreate.

I'm choosing not to have children because I don't feel compelled to have them. Bringing a life into this world is a HUGE responsibility -- emotionally, physically, financially, etc. -- and one that shouldn't be taken lightly. Being a parent -- being a good parent -- is complicated. 

I became an Aunt at age 15 and I love that role. I love my three nieces, I love my four siblings, I love my two cats, I love all of my friends and would protect them as fiercely as a lioness protects her cubs.

5/7/2015 17:29:28,"I want to prioritize my career., I don’t like children., I don’t want the financial responsibility., I like my life as it is.","Life is not limited in the number of experiences available, but regardless of what you are told, one person cannot experience everything. It's a simple fact of life.

I never felt maternal towards babies. Whatever makes a woman able to relate to children and be good with children, I simply lack it. Whatever people mean when they say they feel the biological clock, I never experienced and frankly, don't care to. 

Instead, I've been gifted with a limitless love of art and travel. I will stop and stare at a well-done mural. I will jump on a plane in a moment, if someone asks me to photograph something or someone. And I feel a rush of euphoria every time the plane takes off from the Tarmac. 

Not having children has opened my life to a plethora of experiences and possibilities that, as i know now and have known every time I book a plane ticket, I would never be able to experience if I had a child. I cannot imagine trading in my life for becoming a mother. It's something that I just plain cannot picture. 

Moreover, American parenting has become almost cult-like. The pressure put on mothers, often by their fellow mothers and doubled down upon by ""well meaning"" friends and relatives is so intense that it amazes me how we don't hear more stories of new mothers having nervous breakdowns. The absolutely visceral reaction that Leslie Bennetts receives when she wrote and published ""The Feminine Mistake"" only further underscores how much women are willing to hold onto the image of perfection, whatever the risks are, often at heir own peril. Motherhood only intensifies such pressure. 

So why subject myself to this? 

Logically, why? 

If I don't feel whatever thing that women are supposed to feel towards becoming a mother, is there any reason for me, really, to take the jump? 

Women like myself are often harangued with the age-old ""You will love the baby once it's born!"" - a fallacy that has been repeatedly disproved with news stories of child abuse through the years. Really? Then can we get a refund if it doesn't work out? 

In all reality, I like my life - gypsy-free, adventurous, and full of experiences that I doubt I'd ever have otherwise - precisely the way it is. There's nothing wrong with taking a different path. What's wrong is that the childfree choice is questioned in a way that motherhood will never be. ",

Babysitting multiple children from different backgrounds really brought it home that I didn't want children of my own. I couldn't handle the noise and constantly repeating myself.

It's a dangerous and terminal process that provides no positive effect on the earth(huge carbon print, over populated, humans are like parasites that consume and destroy their host/environment) 

I also prefer not to associate my body parts to children.. My Boobs aren't food and my vagina isn't a people maker :-(

I enjoy freedom and lack of responsibility, and to the people who bring children into the world and don't take responsibility shame on them.
People who have children just because they wanted to make them themselves are selfish.

I would rather allot my time cleaning up the mess we humans have already made...

I had amazing parents, I think kids are adorable, I love my career but also love my personal life, could fully support children if I wanted to and welcome my life both as it is and as it could be, but I still don't choose to have children because I don't feel passionately about raising them.

5/7/2015 22:07:41,"I have a bad relationship with my parents., I don’t want the financial responsibility., I like my life as it is.","It has taken me 55 years to even start to feel sane after an extremely abusive childhood (with parents who did not want children. ( I am now 62. That abuse brought lifelong serious Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder which included serious depression, anxiety, relationship difficulties and trouble remaining stable and employed. I struggled to keep going. I have had ongoing therapy for 30 years. The one thing I always knew from a young age was the one thing I could control was to at least not have kids. I knew I would never be able to give a child what they needed, and could not do that damage to another human being. I also never made enough money to afford myself much less a child. I also did not have the patience nor the biological urge to have a baby like most women. None of the 4 kids in our family had children. Those strong feelings of not having children never, ever changed.  Despite my family disowning me, I refused to have kids to fill that void. I now am healthy, have a good relationship and work as a successful Psychotherapist helping other adults who were abused as children to try to live better lives and raise their children in a healthy way. I put myself through school to get a Master's degree and never took money from anyone. Anyone who says women who choose to be child free are all selfish are blind. I believe that my choice is heroic, as I know I would have damaged a child in my reproductive years, and I still do not have the patience or tolerance now. No, it is not true that I would have changed my mind and I have no regrets. It is a difficult life but not because I should have had kids. What strikes me as tragic is parents judging the child free by choice without investigation, in a self- righteous way when clearly we are a minority. Where is acceptance for one's own needs and preferences?  And though I go not judge others for having children, why must I be ostracized if I choose to avoid loud children on airplanes, restaurants etc. as a preference instead of being labeled a child hater?  I know there are child free by choice people who flaunt all their free time and pursuits, who sound arrogant. Do I treasure my alone time and privacy?  Yes. But I need it for my ongoing trauma recovery or I could not work or function. I also give back to the world every day and have ""raised"" myself and many people. There is something very wrong with a culture that practices contempt prior to investigation. Thank you for letting me speak!",

I love the great outdoors, adventure and spontaneity! I see many people give up much of these things once they have kids. I see that their lives become significantly restricted in comparison to mine. I would never be happy giving up my passions. I am very happy with my life the way it is and I don't want that to change.

Parents lives (in my opinion) become so boring; they mostly talk about diapers, daycare, vomit and school gossip instead of international issues/current events/philosophy/politics. I love reading and learning about new things, especially quantum physics and the origin of the universe. I am constantly educating myself. I don't have time or patience to teach someone 2+2=4... Kid movies, books and conversations bore me.

I've also noticed that many relationships fall apart once kids are in the picture. Many men - I work mostly with men - have admitted to me that they wish they didn't have kids (their wives pushed it) and/or that they're no longer attracted to their wives after their wives had kids. It's one thing to understand why a woman's body changes after birth and to respect that, but you can't force yourself to be attracted to something if you're not (try it)! 

I also think the desire to have kids is often egocentric/selfish. What makes someone think their genes are so excellent that they should pass them on? Couples often talk about how their kids will be the best/smartest/ prettiest/funniest. Parents boast about their kids success but it is a reflection of themselves, of what they've created. That is all ego. I don't believe my modest genes need to be passed on. Also, in the workplace, parents constantly need special accommodations due to child care issues. I'm sorry, but it was your CHOICE to have a child! I understand that you need to be able to care for that child, but to think you deserve to leave earlier than me and have me cover, or work a certain holiday shift, just because you have a kid at home is obnoxious. This leads to the assumption that you believe your reason for such things is more worthy than mine. In reality, no one has a more worthy cause than anyone else and we all want more time away from work...

I have a successful but busy career as a physician. I often struggle to find time for myself so I cannot imagine trying to find time to care for another being. I'd rather meditate, do yoga, workout, read a book, learn a language, climb a mountain, scuba dive to the bottom of the ocean, fly a plane etc in my free time. Life has a lot to offer and I want to experience it all! 

I've seen many co-workers give up much of their dreams in order to have kids. They have so much potential; then it vanishes. Which is fine, because they have replaced their original dream with a new dream of having kids; that makes them happy. But I would prefer to stay on track & reach my full potential in my field! 

Also, when I look around I see many unhappy parents. There are also many happy ones. But you do not know what personality type your child will have, if you will get along, if the kid will have a difficult psychiatric illness, etc. I don't like the amount of risk/unknowns involved in that 18+ year commitment. You're stuck with whatever you get, for better or worse. Not interested in taking the chance of becoming an unhappy parent rather than sticking with my already happy life!

4) I have a small business which I plan to expand a lot and in a short while, seen that my parents are quite aged, I'll have to manage other stuff and I'm an only child (so no help whatsoever).
The point is: I LOVE my work and ""create"" things, provide work for my employees, hire more people and achieving both economical and ethical goals.
5) I don't like children, I actually don't consider people younger than 18 years old. Really, never liked them 
6) I love to have (some) spare time
7) I love my super-quiet house
8) I can't take care of a small rabbit (who, I have to say, is the most patient being), imagine of a baby/child
9) I simply can't picture any changing in that sense
10) If we'd feel like, we'll adopt. I won't generate an human being for the world.

Children give me anxiety and make me super uncomfortable. People say it is different when it's your own, but if you have a child eventually you will have to be surrounded by that child's peers. I have dogs, I'm good. ",

5/8/2015 9:55:18,"I don’t like children., I don’t want the financial responsibility., I like my life as it is.","I think that too often men, and women in particular, don't take the time to honestly ask themselves *why* they want children? Is it because having children is what you're ""supposed"" to do? College (check), marriage (check), children (check).  People put more thought into buying a house, a car, what they're going to have for dinner than they do about whether or not to bring a LIFE into this world. Is your family dropping not so subtle hints and you feel obligated to ""give your parents grandchildren""?  How about the more selfish, narcissistic reasons: you want someone to love you unconditionally (at least until puberty hits); you want someone to be able to do all of things you never did (living vicariously through your children); you want all of the attention and gifts (gender reveal parties, anyone?) that having a baby brings; you want someone to take care of you when you're old. And the childed say the child free are selfish when we want live our *own* lives, love *ourselves* unconditionally, and save up enough money so that we don't have to depend on anyone else to take care of us when we're old. 

Those who choose not to have children have thought deeply and contemplatively about these, and the many other reasons why they don't want children. (I didn't even mention all of the environmental impact of having kids.)  The active and repeated decision to not have children takes a lot more work than the childed realize. Birth control, vasectomies, tubal ligations-- the endless fight to be *allowed* to have a tubal ligation. It's not as if we say, ""I don't want children"" and the mere declaration makes it so. We have to be active and proactive in our choice every day. 

I don't know when the realization solidified that I Do.Not.Want.Children., but it was probably around the time *everyone* else in my peer group started having children. I looked around and said this is NOT what I want. I don't want to be someone’s ""mother"". I don't want to lose ""me""-- at 33 I'm still trying to figure out who the heck ""me"" is!  I don't want the responsibility of teaching another human being not to be a little asshole, especially when the prime examples of humanity these days are all assholes! 

I don't want to have to stress about the cost of day care, and the best preschool, and what brand of clothes the cool kids are wearing, and how much college is going to cost. Why is not wanting these things considered selfish?  I have plenty of other general stress in my life without adding the responsibility for another life to the mix. I get up and go to work every day, I cook dinner every night, I help keep my house clean, I pay my bills on time, I treat animals kindly, I support public radio,  I recycle. Why are these things not enough for me to be considered responsible and contributing member of society... unless I do all these things AND have a child?

There are so many other avenues I could venture down in this debate. The fact that I'm not seen as a fully-formed women unless I have a child. The talk of so-called ""biological imperatives""...

The truth of the matter is, I've put a lot of thought and action into my decision not to have children. And it's a decision that I am totally and completely happy with. There has not been a single day that I've said, ""I wish I had children"". (And that's saying something considering how many women are now ""coming out"" saying they wish they *didn't* have children.)  My choice not to have a child does not make me less of a woman. I say it makes me more so, because I have chosen to make my life about more than just my biology.

Many of my friends are shocked and confused by this, and just don't understand how I don't want a child. I've been called strange and selfish countless times because of this choice. But to me, it seems selfish to have a child just because it's seen as 'the thing you do' or to look after you/ keep you company in your old age. Those are the only reasons I can see that I would personally have a child, as I'm really not bothered about continuing my genetic lineage. I'm not that important. If I don't really want to do something, I won't be able to give it my all and I don't see it as worth doing...that applies ten fold when a human life is in the equation!   

I just don't want to be a mother. I don't see it as an important thing for me to do. I have a list of things I want to achieve, not limited to just within my career, which would be very hard to accomplish with a child in tow. People talk to me of regret, that I'll look back and wish I'd given birth rather then learnt the violin or traveled to India. I don't feel that I've had to choose these things over having a child, as I never wanted a child like I wanted to do these things. There has never been a choice to make. I've never looked at a baby and become broody. I appreciate how cute children are and how amazing human development is, but the thought of spending the rest of my life taking care of another person is a rather claustrophobic thought! However lovely and challenging having a child might be, it isn't something I want. I can understand why others would want that, I just wish others could bring themselves to understand why I, and others like me, wouldn't.

My partner of the last 7 years is also decided to remain child free. It's something he and I decided early on in our relationship. Which I'm thankful for, as also even within the most equal of relationships it's likely simply down to the structure of maternity pay in the UK (and biology!) that I would be the one that would need to leave the workplace for the longest period of time to have a child. I simply don't want that. Stranger again, he has never been questioned when he says he doesn't want children. I am questioned. Every. Single. Time. 

Ultimately the answer to the question, why don't you want to have children is as follows - 

I don't want to.

No reason is, nor should, be necessary. It shouldn't be seen as strange. Some people need to have children, they have the urge to bring life into the world and it gives them a feeling of worth and happiness. Some people get their feelings of worth and happiness from other facets of theirs lives like their career, their hobby, travel, music, education or by volunteering for charity organisations...whatever it is.

1.) I have known since I was six years old that I did not want children. Even as a child, being surrounded by other, screaming children gave me absolute sensory overload. That has never changed. 

2.) I later found out that I have a genetic disorder I have a 50/50 chance of passing on to any offspring, and that therefore, it was recommended that I do not have children biologically. 

3.) The above was the best news I had ever heard as it gave me a built in excuse to throw out there, because many people try to shame women who choose to be childless. If you are female and don't want to have children, no matter what your reason - you are selfish.

4.) I do not like the stress carrying, bearing and raising a child puts on one's life and health. I don't want my body to be put through that trauma, and, 

5.) with the state of the world, I can't imagine purposely bringing someone in to it to suffer and then die. I have the same philosophy around children as I do my pets - if I should feel in the future that I want a child, I would adopt an older child that is need of a home and love, instead of giving birth to a biological child - I'd rather have to raise and love one that was already brought into the world and abandoned.

6.) I've always been a massive introvert, and need time to be isolated and rebuild. That's not possible with children. I'd rather enjoy giving my time and energy to my rescue pets, and my friends' children, than have my own children that are grabbing on me and needing me 24/7.

7.) I've never had a biological clock, and cannot understand at all the desire to have children, and why women are considered incomplete, or a failure if they aren't married with children.",

Also ""having children"" is a misnomer. Children are children for a negligible part of their life.

She parented by yelling and being overprotective and I know that's the type of mother I would turn out to be. I have younger half siblings a lot of childcare responsibilities fell to me, so in a way I feel like I've already raised children. 

I don't have the patience to deal with children. I can't stand having to repeat myself. I hate seeing unparented children in public.

My husband and I are trying to get ourselves out of debt, and that would never happen if we had kids. We want the financial freedom to pick and up if need be. It's much easier to get a puppy sitter than it is a babysitter. 

I've also had weight issues my entire adult life. I can't imagine putting my body through a pregnancy.  ",

5/11/2015 13:15:43,"I want to prioritize my career., I don’t like children., I don’t want the financial responsibility., I like my life as it is.","There is another reason that I don't want children which is not listed. That is that I don't want the social identity of being a mother. In our society, being a mother is a cliche handed to all girls and women from the time we are small children. I don't want other people to view me as solely domestic, solely nurturing, and totally self-sacrificing. To me, being viewed as a mother erases my identity as an individual. 

There is one more reason which is important to me, which is finding my own personal meaning and purpose. If I became a parent, I would be giving up my desire to make a difference in the world and leave a lasting legacy in favour of investing my hopes for change in my children and leaving only a biological legacy. This is in essence choosing to live vicariously through my children rather than putting in the work to change things myself, which would give my own life purpose. Many people who once dreamed of curing cancer or ending world hunger have settled for the seemingly more realistic dream of having a family. Many pass their own stifled ambitions on to the next generation, who may or may not share their interests. The people around me who have children have all given something up- dreams of a certain career, travel, artistic pursuits, academic degrees, an athletic lifestyle, living in a favourite city or near family and friends, and so on. When I see this happen to my friends, and now to one of my sisters, I feel like mourning for these lost possibilities in their lives. 

All of these parents have expressed regret at one point or another for something they've given up to have children. They suspend their goals indefinitely, and many of them never seem to get back to them. They don't have time, or they lose confidence in themselves. They tell me that they wish they had done it back when they were single, since now they have probably lost the ability. 

I wish I could change things for them. I wish I could turn back time and allow them to make their own dreams come true before having children. Not having children myself is my insurance against regret, against having a life not fully lived. The worst decisions I've ever made are the ones in which I've settled for something. And to me, having children when you have not accomplished what you wish for in life is the ultimate form of settling.",

I could list reasons why but when you come right down to it, I simply have no interest in it, and why would I dedicate my life to a pursuit I have zero interest in? Parenthood is all consuming and as such I believe the only people who should have kids are those who truly feel it is their life calling to parent. As my decision is often questioned I have put many years of thought into whether or not I should be a parent and the truth is, emphatically, that I would not be happy as a mother. As an INTJ personality type, I love being alone and the demands of children leave me anxious and extremely stressed. I am happy with myself, my husband, and my pets.  I think a lot about the future and understand I will not have children to look after me in my old age, but knowing people in that position already I think its a pretty selfish reason to have kids.

Adding to the human population is irresponsible and harmful to the earth.
I also do not want the expense. It is hard enough to get by without another mouth to feed. Education and life experiences are too important to me to give up for another individual. If I were to have a child I would spend all of my money on their education and would not be able to take trips or retire when I am old. And if I die before then, the people I love will benefit from my hard work.
My genetics are nothing special and I would not want to pass them on to a child. I also struggle with depression and would not be able to provide the level of care I feel would be best for a child. The last thing I need is a little version of me running around picking up all my bad habits.

5/12/2015 0:48:15,I don’t want the financial responsibility.,"I have many reason, this is only one. I care for my mother, which is a huge expence as she's only just turned 65 and I've been at it 5 years. We have a rare genetic disease, which is why she needs care. I could not afford a kid, even if I wanted one, due to this expense. Then there's that genetic disease. Knowingly padding along something horrid with 100% probability (as in my case) is selfish. Oh! I love you, kid! Now live in pain. What a nice gift. 

I'm solvent, am preparing for my own older age and manage a household while running a business. Adding a kid to that would completely take away my future and, frankly, I don't believe it's a children's responsibility to care for their parents, my mom and I just love and understand one another. 

But let's add overpopulation. Its a HUGE DEAL and one y'all are ignoring. 

No, I don't like all kids. I like a lot of them, the ones who aren't entitled snots. Yes, I am prioritizing my career, but for reasons above. I have no idea how long I'll be able to continue working until I'm in my mother's position. Yes, I am being financially responsible (not only for myself, but others...would any out there like to pay for my messed up kid? Thought not.) And yes, I like my life as it is. I do get time away. I can play my ukulele as loud as I want, pour my time and efforts into loved ones, maintain a great relationship with my mom and male, childfree partner, play with my pug and know we aren't adding to the problem of overpopulation. 

I knew when I was five, before genetics took hold, that I didn't want to be a parent. I've always known it wasn't my future. Cleaning up beaches, cooking meals, working like a dog and helping someone I love end their life on a high note sounds good and fulfilling to me. I've lost nothing by opting out of parenthood. It wouldn't have made me a better person, friend, partner, daughter or self. I nurture other people just fine, many of them kids.

I also didn't want to raise anyone alone. Almost all my friends are single parents. I wasn't interested in in babies, they freak me out until they can walk and talk and do things, that's when people get interesting. I also don't want to be one of the grandmothers raiding their grandkids because my kid bugged out. They call them Silver Strollers in my part of Florida. 

Motherhood is important, but not everything a woman can be, I was aware of that at an early age. Why else would other women have fought for my right to choose this? 

I love my childed friends, even the ones that fall down the mommy rabbit hole for a few years. My friends are raising excellent future adults, something I think most of the mommy brigade seem to forget is the real job - not kids, well adjusted, purposeful, sensitive, compassionate adults. I applaud them.  I support them and their kids. 

You couldn't pay me enough to do it myself. ",
